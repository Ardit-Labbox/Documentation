## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting 
elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, 
Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.

In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and
phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. 
When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the 
text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it 
(e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks 
before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**).

You can add Markdown formatting elements to a plaintext file using a text 
editor application. Or you can use one of the many Markdown applications 
for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android operating systems. There are 
also several web-based applications specifically designed for writing 
in Markdown.

## Why Use Markdown?
You might be wondering why people use Markdown instead of a WYSIWYG editor. 
Why write with Markdown when you can press buttons in an interface to format 
your text? As it turns out, there are several reasons why people use 
Markdown instead of WYSIWYG editors.

  - Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create websites,
  documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.
  - Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using 
  virtually any application. If you decide you don’t like the Markdown application 
  you’re currently using, you can import your Markdown files into another Markdown 
  application. That’s in stark contrast to word processing applications like Microsoft 
  Word that lock your content into a proprietary file format.
  - Markdown is platform independent. You can create Markdown-formatted text on any
  device running any operating system.
  - Markdown is future proof. Even if the application you’re using stops working at 
  some point in the future, you’ll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text 
  using a text editing application. This is an important consideration when it comes to
  books, university theses, and other milestone documents that need to be preserved indefinitely.
  - Markdown is everywhere. Websites like Reddit and GitHub support Markdown, and lots 
  of desktop and web-based applications support it.
  
  ## How Does it Work?
  Dillinger makes writing in Markdown easy because it hides the stuff happening behind the 
  scenes, but it’s worth exploring how the process works in general.

  When you write in Markdown, the text is stored in a plaintext file that has an .md or .markdown 
  extension. But then what? How is your Markdown-formatted file converted into HTML or a 
  print-ready document?
  The short answer is that you need a Markdown application capable of processing the Markdown file.
  There are lots of applications available — everything from simple scripts to desktop 
  applications that look like Microsoft Word.
  Markdown applications use something called a Markdown processor (also commonly referred to as a
  “parser” or an “implementation”) to take the Markdown-formatted text and output it to HTML format.
  To summarize, this is a four-part process:
  -  Create a Markdown file using a text editor or a dedicated Markdown application. The file should have an .md or .markdown extension.
  -  Open the Markdown file in a Markdown application.
  -  Use the Markdown application to convert the Markdown file to an HTML document.
  -  View the HTML file in a web browser or use the Markdown application to convert it to another file format, like PDF.

## What’s Markdown Good For?
Markdown is a fast and easy way to take notes, create content for a website, and produce print-ready documents.

It doesn’t take long to learn the Markdown syntax, and once you know how to use it, you can write using Markdown 
just about everywhere. Most people use Markdown to create content for the web, but Markdown is good for formatting 
everything from email messages to grocery lists.
