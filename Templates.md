## What is a template?
A template is a form, mold or pattern used as a guide to make something. Here are some examples of templates:

   - Website design
   - Creating a document
   - Knitting a sweater

While the dictionary definition of a template is pretty straightforward, there are a number of use cases for templates.

## Why are templates beneficial?
Using a template is beneficial because it can help you create something quickly and efficiently, from a pattern or 
standard operating procedure (SOP) that has been successful in the past.

Creating a template can save you time in the long run because you won't need to start 
from scratch each time you want to make something new.

It can also ensure that your final product is consistent and of high quality.

## Examples of template use cases

  - **Documents:** Document templates typically contain placeholder text or a standard layout that should be 
  repeated for each new file created. Thus, the template allows users to reuse certain standard section 
  of text and simply fill in the variable parts rather than create an entirely new document every time.
  We will be using a tamplate for documenting each issue that we complete.
  - **Programming flowcharts:** In programming, a template can be used to create Unified Modeling Language 
  (UML) diagrams like activity diagrams, class diagrams and sequence diagrams.
  We will be using templates when we want to create diagrams, that will show the work of the code.
  - **Coding:** Coding templates are used to make the code more readable and understandable. Because in the 
  embedded modules we will work with C++ we will follow the Google C++ Style Guide, it will be more explained in 
  the developers guide.
  
  The idea of the templates is that every programmer will work in the same way, to work better as a team, to be more 
  coordinated and not to lose time on understanding others code.
  
## What should a src folder contain?
Each prorgammer first should create a folder with the same name of the user story.
In the root folder it should **always** contain a src folder, include folder, README.md and CONTRIBUTED.md.
Now let explained what each of those will do.
  - **src:** It should contain the main function of each modul
  - **include:** It should contain only the header files and third party libraries.
    - **Header file:** It contains the function signatures, and declaration of the functions and variables that 
    will be used in the main.
    - **Third Party Library:** Are the libraries that are not created by a Labbox programmer, libraries that are
    downloaded.
  - **README.md:** Is the file that explaines what is the solution, what it solves, how it solves the problem,...
  - **CONTRIBUTED.md:** It contains the explanation on how to use this issue, how to flash to the board, what to 
  have in mind before using it.
